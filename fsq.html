      <p>FGC Sabo, with its inception in 1994, was founded by the visionary Reverend Chinedu Emmanuel, who faithfully guided the church for a remarkable decade before gracefully transitioning the mantle to his esteemed associate, Reverend Tunde Fashoranti. Under Reverend Fashoranti's anointed leadership, the church thrived for an additional twelve fruitful years, fostering spiritual growth, nurturing faith, and cultivating a strong foundation for the congregation before handing over the baton to our current esteemed Senior Pastor. Throughout its rich history, FGC Sabo has consistently upheld its motto, 'Adding Value To Your Life....', a testament to the transformative impact experienced by over 200 devoted members who confidently bear witness to the life-changing value derived from their association with the church.</p>
